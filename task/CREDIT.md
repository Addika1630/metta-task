# Decentralized Credit Scoring System

### Problem Statement

In emerging markets like developing regions, millions of individuals remain unbanked or underbanked, largely excluded from access to formal credit due to the absence of 
traditional financial histories. Conventional credit scoring systems depend on centralized institutions and documented financial behavior, which are often unavailable 
in these regions. This exclusion limits opportunities for personal and economic growth. 

With the growth of mobile money and decentralized finance (DeFi), there is a critical opportunity to bridge this gap. However, DeFi platforms lack reliable, 
decentralized mechanisms to assess credit risk without traditional credit scores. This creates a challenge in offering credit safely and equitably.

The goal is to build a decentralized, privacy-preserving credit scoring system that uses alternative data sources—such as mobile money transactions, blockchain activity,
and utility payments—to assess creditworthiness. Such a system would empower DeFi platforms to extend fair, transparent credit to underserved populations, fostering 
greater financial inclusion and economic resilience.

### Objective

Frame this business need into a data science problem:
Develop a credit scoring model using blockchain data, enriched with anomaly detection techniques, to Develop a decentralized credit scoring model using blockchain data 
and anomaly detection techniques to assess user creditworthiness without traditional credit reports. The model should leverage on-chain data, ensuring privacy,
transparency, and scalability while providing a non-custodial solution for evaluating creditworthiness within the decentralized finance ecosystem.

### Data Required

To build the credit scoring model, the following data features will be collected and analyzed:

  - **Account Activity**: This metric measures how active a user is by calculating the number of transactions made relative to the account's lifespan. A fixed start and end date will be used to ensure consistent analysis of account activity within defined timeframes.

  - **Health Factor**: A numerical value representing the safety of deposited assets, calculated as the ratio of collateral deposited to the amount borrowed. A Health Factor close to 1 is ideal to avoid liquidation risks.

  - **Loan to Value (LTV)**: This ratio indicates the loan amount in comparison to the value of the collateral. Higher LTV ratios signify higher risk in lending assessments.

  - **Current Liquidity Threshold**: This percentage indicates the liquidity level beyond which the user risks liquidation. Higher thresholds mean the user is closer to potential liquidation.

  - **Total Collateral**: The total amount of collateral the user has deposited. Higher collateral suggests greater safety for the lender.

  - **Available Borrows**: The borrowing capacity left for the user. It represents how much the user can borrow based on available collateral.

  - **Credit Mix (Diversification)**: This feature measures how diversified the user's credit portfolio is. A diverse mix indicates a better ability to manage different types of credit and reduce risk.

  - **Repayment Rate**: This calculates the percentage of the loan that has been repaid. Higher repayment rates indicate a responsible borrower.


### Proposed Metrics for Success

- **Credit Score Accuracy**: This metric evaluates how well the credit scoring model aligns with real-world loan outcomes, such as repayment and default rates. It measures the model's ability to provide a reliable representation of user creditworthiness based on blockchain data, which is essential for ensuring that users receive fair assessments.

- **Anomaly Detection Effectiveness**: This metric assesses the model's capacity to identify outliers or anomalies in user behavior, which may indicate higher credit risk. By detecting unusual activity or risky behavior, the model can flag users who are more likely to default on loans, thus reducing the overall risk in the system.

- **Model Scalability**: Scalability measures the model’s ability to handle an increasing number of users and transactions over time without a significant drop in performance. Since blockchain networks like Aave can scale to accommodate millions of users, the model must be able to process large datasets efficiently, which ensures that it can be applied to a wide range of users in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

- **Repayment Prediction Accuracy**: This metric evaluates the model's ability to accurately predict whether a user will repay their loan. Accurate repayment prediction is crucial for ensuring that the system can identify users who are likely to default or struggle with repayment, allowing lenders to make informed decisions based on that insight.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Risk mitigation measures how well the model reduces the likelihood of defaults or financial losses. By incorporating various factors such as health factor, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and credit mix, the model should help minimize high-risk loans and protect lenders, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the decentralized lending platform.


### High-Level Plan for Analysis and Modeling

To effectively build the decentralized credit scoring system, we will proceed with a structured analysis and modeling process. This process will ensure that the credit scoring model is robust, transparent, and scalable. Below is the detailed and structured approach:

1. Data Preprocessing

   The first step is to preprocess the data. This involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring the raw data to ensure it is suitable for modeling.

   - Handle Missing Data: Missing values can distort the analysis and modeling process. These will either be imputed using statistical methods (e.g., mean or median
     imputation) or rows with excessive missing data will be removed, depending on the extent.

   - Remove Outliers: Extreme outliers can skew the results. Outliers will be identified using methods like Z-scores or IQR and handled appropriately.

   - Data Normalization: Normalize the features to bring them into a comparable scale (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization). This ensures that
    features with larger scales (like collateral values) do not disproportionately affect the model.

   - Feature Selection: Identify key features for the model, ensuring that only the most relevant data is included, based on the objective of the decentralized credit
    score.
  
2. Feature Engineering

   Feature engineering is critical to ensure that the model has the necessary inputs to make accurate predictions. The following features will be created and
   analyzed:

   - Account Activity: Calculate the frequency of transactions and interactions over the user’s account lifetime. This can be done by counting transactions within
     specified time windows (e.g., per month or year).

   - Health Factor: Create a metric that represents the safety of a user’s assets. This will be the ratio of collateral deposited to the amount borrowed. A value
     closer to 1 indicates a safer position.

   - Loan-to-Value (LTV): This ratio indicates the risk in lending by comparing the loan amount with the value of the collateral. Higher LTV values indicate higher
     lending risk.

   - Current Liquidity Threshold: Define the user’s proximity to liquidation, based on their current available collateral and borrowings. This feature helps assess
     the user’s potential default risk.

   - Total Collateral: Measure the total amount of collateral deposited by the user. Higher collateral usually indicates lower risk, as more assets are available to
     back the loan.

   - Available Borrowing Capacity: This metric measures how much a user can still borrow based on their existing collateral.

   - Credit Mix (Diversification): A diversified credit portfolio suggests that a user is managing multiple types of debt, which can reduce default risk.

   - Repayment Rate: Calculate the percentage of loans successfully repaid by the user. Higher repayment rates indicate responsible behavior and lower credit risk.

3. Designing the Credit Scoring Model

   The heart of the system will be a credit scoring model that integrates blockchain data and anomaly detection. Below is the step-by-step breakdown:

   - Credit Score Formula

     The credit score will be based on a weighted sum of various factors:

      Credit Score = P + A + L + C - X

      Where:

     - **P** = Payment History (38.5%)
     - **A** = Amount Owed (33.5%)
     - **L** = Length of Credit History (16.5%)
     - **C** = Credit Mix (11.5%)
     - **X** = Anomaly Score (calculated using machine learning)

   - Anomaly Detection Integration:
     Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in identifying outliers or atypical behavior that could indicate high risk. This will be incorporated using machine
     learning models, specifically autoencoders:

     - Autoencoder Structure: An autoencoder will be trained to learn compressed representations of user behavior. When a user exhibits behavior outside the learned
       "normal" range, this will result in a higher reconstruction error.
     - Anomaly Scoring: Based on the reconstruction error, an anomaly score will be computed. Higher scores suggest higher risk and are subtracted from the credit
       score.


4. Model Development and Training

- Split the Data: Begin by dividing the dataset into training and test sets (typically 80/20 split) to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

- Model Type: Implement an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm (autoencoders), which is ideal for identifying outliers in user behavior when no labels are
  provided.

- Autoencoder Model:
  - Network Design: An autoencoder network will be built with multiple layers to learn compressed representations of user transaction and borrowing behaviors. The
    encoder will reduce dimensionality, while the decoder will reconstruct the data.

  - Training: The model will be trained to minimize reconstruction error using Mean Squared Logarithmic Loss (MSLL) as the loss function.

  - Optimization: The network will be optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with backpropagation for weight adjustment.

- Model Evaluation:

  - Loss Function: The model will be evaluated using the reconstruction error (MSE or MSLL) to identify how well the autoencoder predicts normal behavior.

  - Thresholding: Set thresholds for anomaly detection (e.g., 1 standard deviation above the mean error) to classify a data point as anomalous.

5. Anomaly Detection and Thresholding

   Once the autoencoder is trained, the model will use the reconstruction error to detect anomalies in real-time.

   - Anomaly Threshold:

     - Set a threshold to classify data points as anomalous if their reconstruction error exceeds a set number of standard deviations from the mean.

     - This threshold will be fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal anomaly detection without excessive false positives.

   - Anomaly Scoring:
   
     - The reconstruction error will be normalized to derive an anomaly score. This score will be integrated into the final credit score formula to reduce the
       overall credit score for users exhibiting risky behavior.


6. Evaluation and Testing
   
   The model will undergo rigorous evaluation to assess its effectiveness in predicting creditworthiness:

   - Evaluation Metrics:

     - False Positives/Negatives: Measure how often the model incorrectly classifies users as low-risk (false negatives) or high-risk (false positives).

     - Credit Score Accuracy: Compare the predicted credit score with actual loan outcomes (repayment vs. default).

     - Anomaly Detection Precision: Assess how well the anomaly detection system identifies high-risk behavior without flagging too many false anomalies.

   - Testing on Unseen Data: Test the model on a held-out test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

   - Fine-tuning: Based on the evaluation results, adjust the thresholds for anomaly detection and re-train the model to optimize performance.


### Conclusion

The decentralized credit scoring system offers a fair, transparent, and privacy-preserving alternative to traditional credit assessments by utilizing blockchain data and anomaly detection. By analyzing on-chain data, the system empowers underserved populations to access credit without relying on traditional credit reports, fostering financial inclusion. Anomaly detection helps minimize risk by identifying high-risk behaviors, ensuring more accurate creditworthiness evaluations. This approach has the potential to reshape credit scoring in decentralized finance, enabling safer, more equitable access to credit and driving economic growth.
