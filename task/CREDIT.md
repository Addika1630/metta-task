# Decentralized Credit Scoring System

### Problem Statement

In emerging markets like developing regions, millions of individuals remain unbanked or underbanked, largely excluded from access to formal credit due to the absence of 
traditional financial histories. Conventional credit scoring systems depend on centralized institutions and documented financial behavior, which are often unavailable 
in these regions. This exclusion limits opportunities for personal and economic growth. 

With the growth of mobile money and decentralized finance (DeFi), there is a critical opportunity to bridge this gap. However, DeFi platforms lack reliable, 
decentralized mechanisms to assess credit risk without traditional credit scores. This creates a challenge in offering credit safely and equitably.

The goal is to build a decentralized, privacy-preserving credit scoring system that uses alternative data sources‚Äîsuch as mobile money transactions, blockchain activity,
and utility payments‚Äîto assess creditworthiness. Such a system would empower DeFi platforms to extend fair, transparent credit to underserved populations, fostering 
greater financial inclusion and economic resilience.

### Objective

Frame this business need into a data science problem:
Develop a credit scoring model using blockchain data, enriched with anomaly detection techniques, to Develop a decentralized credit scoring model using blockchain data 
and anomaly detection techniques to assess user creditworthiness without traditional credit reports. The model should leverage on-chain data, ensuring privacy,
transparency, and scalability while providing a non-custodial solution for evaluating creditworthiness within the decentralized finance ecosystem.

### Data Required

To build the credit scoring model, the following data features will be collected and analyzed:

  - **Account Activity**: This metric measures how active a user is by calculating the number of transactions made relative to the account's lifespan. A fixed start and end date will be used to ensure consistent analysis of account activity within defined timeframes.

  - **Health Factor**: A numerical value representing the safety of deposited assets, calculated as the ratio of collateral deposited to the amount borrowed. A Health Factor close to 1 is ideal to avoid liquidation risks.

  - **Loan to Value (LTV)**: This ratio indicates the loan amount in comparison to the value of the collateral. Higher LTV ratios signify higher risk in lending assessments.

  - **Current Liquidity Threshold**: This percentage indicates the liquidity level beyond which the user risks liquidation. Higher thresholds mean the user is closer to potential liquidation.

  - **Total Collateral**: The total amount of collateral the user has deposited. Higher collateral suggests greater safety for the lender.

  - **Available Borrows**: The borrowing capacity left for the user. It represents how much the user can borrow based on available collateral.

  - **Credit Mix (Diversification)**: This feature measures how diversified the user's credit portfolio is. A diverse mix indicates a better ability to manage different types of credit and reduce risk.

  - **Repayment Rate**: This calculates the percentage of the loan that has been repaid. Higher repayment rates indicate a responsible borrower.


### Proposed Metrics for Success

- **Credit Score Accuracy**: This metric evaluates how well the credit scoring model aligns with real-world loan outcomes, such as repayment and default rates. It measures the model's ability to provide a reliable representation of user creditworthiness based on blockchain data, which is essential for ensuring that users receive fair assessments.

- **Anomaly Detection Effectiveness**: This metric assesses the model's capacity to identify outliers or anomalies in user behavior, which may indicate higher credit risk. By detecting unusual activity or risky behavior, the model can flag users who are more likely to default on loans, thus reducing the overall risk in the system.

- **Model Scalability**: Scalability measures the model‚Äôs ability to handle an increasing number of users and transactions over time without a significant drop in performance. Since blockchain networks like Aave can scale to accommodate millions of users, the model must be able to process large datasets efficiently, which ensures that it can be applied to a wide range of users in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

- **Repayment Prediction Accuracy**: This metric evaluates the model's ability to accurately predict whether a user will repay their loan. Accurate repayment prediction is crucial for ensuring that the system can identify users who are likely to default or struggle with repayment, allowing lenders to make informed decisions based on that insight.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Risk mitigation measures how well the model reduces the likelihood of defaults or financial losses. By incorporating various factors such as health factor, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and credit mix, the model should help minimize high-risk loans and protect lenders, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the decentralized lending platform.


### High-Level Plan for Analysis and Modeling


Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing or inconsistent values.

Normalize the features (e.g., using min-max normalization) to ensure that all data is within the same range.

Create a structured DataFrame containing key features like Account Activity, Health Factor, LTV, and Credit Mix.

3. Feature Engineering
Key Features:

Account Activity: Frequency of interactions, transactions per time unit.

Health Factor: A ratio of collateral to borrowed assets, representing the safety of a user‚Äôs assets.

Loan-to-Value (LTV): The ratio of a user's borrowing capacity to their collateral. High LTV indicates higher risk.

Credit Mix: Diversity of the user's credit portfolio.

Repayment Rate: Percentage of loans successfully repaid by the user.

4. Credit Score Formula and Model Design
Credit Score Formula:

The formula to calculate the credit score is a weighted sum of various factors: Payment History (38.5%), Amount Owed (33.5%), Length of Credit History (16.5%), Credit Mix (11.5%), and Anomaly Score (20%).

Credit¬†Score=P+A+L+C‚àíX
Where:

L = Length of Credit History

C = Credit Mix

X = Anomaly Score (calculated using machine learning)

Anomaly Detection:

Objective: Use machine learning (ML) to identify anomalous user behavior, such as default risk.

Modeling Approach: Implement an unsupervised learning algorithm, specifically autoencoders, for anomaly detection.

Autoencoders are trained to reconstruct data, and anomalous data points will have a higher reconstruction error, which helps in identifying unusual behavior patterns.

5. Model Development and Training
Unsupervised Learning with Autoencoders:

Build an autoencoder network to learn compressed representations of the user's on-chain data.

Train the autoencoder on "normal" user data to minimize reconstruction error.

Identify anomalies by measuring reconstruction error: Data points with high reconstruction error are classified as anomalous.

Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Use TensorFlow or other frameworks to build and train the autoencoder.

Optimize the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and calculate the loss using Mean Squared Logarithmic Loss.

Train for a set number of epochs (e.g., 20 epochs) to fine-tune the model.

6. Anomaly Detection and Thresholding
Thresholding:

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the reconstruction error on the training set.

Set a threshold to classify a data point as anomalous if its reconstruction error exceeds one standard deviation from the mean.

Anomaly Scoring:

The anomaly score 
ùëã
X is computed based on the reconstruction error. A higher anomaly score indicates higher risk, which is then subtracted from the credit score formula.

7. Evaluation and Testing
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics, such as the rate of false positives and false negatives in anomaly detection.

Test the model on a held-out test set to measure its ability to generalize.

Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results and adjust the thresholds for anomaly detection.
